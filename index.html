    I’m a first-year PhD student in the Linguistics Department at Yale. 
    </br> I am a first-year PhD student in the Linguistics Department at Yale. My primary advisor 
    is Jason Shaw. Broadly, I am interested in the relationship of linguistic knowledge to its 
    physical implementation. Most recently, my research has investigated the phonetic effects of 
    lexical and phonological contrast using the dynamical model of speech planning developed by 
    Roon and Gafos (2016). the temporal aspects of language and speech, at the relatively long 
    time scales of learning, as well as the relatively short time scales of speech planning, 
    production and perception. I am interested in the use of dynamical systems to model the 
    interactions between knowledge, articulation and perception. 

    Before coming to Yale, I got my MA in Linguistics at the Graduate Center, 
    City University of New York (CUNY). My thesis, advised by Kyle Gorman and 
    Gita Martohardjono, examined…While at the Graduate Center, I also worked in the 
    econd Language Acquisition Lab (SLAL) under the advisement of Gita Martohardjono.

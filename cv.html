    My primary research goal is to use language as a window through which to better understand the relationship between the mind and the physical world.

Broadly, I am interested in the relationship of linguistic knowledge to its physical implementation. </br></br>

Most recently, my research has investigated the phonetic effects of lexical and phonological contrast using the dynamical model of speech planning developed by Roon and Gafos (2016). </br></br>

the temporal aspects of language and speech, at the relatively long time scales of learning, as well as the relatively short time scales of speech planning, production and perception. 

I am interested in the use of dynamical systems to model the interactions between knowledge, articulation and perception.</br></br>

I am also working with Veneeta Dayal, in collaboration with Gita Martohardjono and Sherry Chen at the Graduate Center, City University of New York, to investigate...</br></br>

Before coming to Yale, I got my MA in Linguistics at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY). My thesis, advised by Kyle Gorman and Gita Martohardjono, examinedâ€¦</br></br>

While at the Graduate Center, I also worked in the Second Language Acquisition Lab (SLAL) under the advisement of Gita Martohardjono. Primarily, I worked 

Before discovering linguistics, I got my BA in Social Thought & Political Economy at UMass Amherst.
